hot swap nodes

methods to create topo, change connections

stop/pause/restart nodes

examples

remote hosts

variable arg counts to pass in opts to runner and topology. 
- debug to console or file
- watch node files for reload on change

use pull based messages instead of pubsub so round robin and
restart-without-loss is possible (Redis lists, blocking reads)

abstract out pipes

other transports (0MQ?)

pass commands to daemonized topo

node.process - 1 or 2 args. if 2, then channel is first msg second,
else msg is first and channel is default
